make chart type configurable
use caching headers on js and css and html, include version in file name
cache saved files
use weak references to keep track of all clients. close connections on server shutdown?
display error on structure tab if no schemas are returned
show a helpful message when no saved files are found or when the directory doesn't exist
add padding inside select list, longest name overlaps scrollbar
put current structure table and schema in url params?
add github action to update deps or enable dependabot
make status have a tooltip with the full error.
make "check console" a link that opens the console?
maybe move db list into app
test:
 - executing when viewing a file after changing selection
 - executing when viewing a file after changing query
 - back clears query and updates tab
 - changing tabs while querying
 - submitting an empty query
 - submitting a new query while waiting for another, cancels and submits the new query
 - a db config without a table lists all tables in the structure tab and can be queried
 - test params for file queries
 - tabbing between tabs, the editor and the various buttons
 - copy to clipboard, first js unit test
 - downloading
 - autocomplete tables, aliases, joins, etc.
 - airbrake notifications
 - pagination
 - max rows
 - decimal rendering
 - SqlParser.split.
maybe add support for tags on database config to easily see production vs staging for instance
add a help tab
browser notifications when query completes if on other browser tab or other SQLUI tab
the editor is too short on a large screen. it should be a percentage
warn when closing the browser with unsaved changes? what do other sites do?
javascript unit tests
add images to README
server unit tests
run test coverage
does the server have to be static?
shutting down via ctrl-c messes up the console
move logs to file during test
use sqlui version as query param to css and js. Send in all json requests. Return an error if versions mismatch and tell the user to restart.
In development use version plus timestamp when server starts. Add a heartbeat to the app which autoreloads on version mismatch.
check whether current master is green before releasing
set a cookie for current default submit button
the case where a user types "select table.foo from table t". the alias breaks the select
render streamed results as they are returned
get rid of max rows on the server in favor of max bytes
sql errors should be 400s and should not go to Airbrake
host sqlui as a demo somewhere
Add the ability to demo with a client-side fake server
Display number of rows affected if different from rows returned. 
make it possible to focus on table and use arrows to highlight cells
Add ability to auto-refresh current query
When auto-refreshing, show browser notification if results change.
