 - executing when viewing a file after changing query
 - back clears query and updates tab
 - changing tabs while querying
 - submitting an empty query
 - submitting a new query while waiting for another, cancels and submits the new query
 - a db config without a table lists all tables in the structure tab and can be queried

use sqlui version as query param to css and js. Send in all json requests. Return an error if versions mismatch and tell the user to restart.
In development use version plus timestamp when server starts. Add a heartbeat to the app which autoreloads on version mismatch.
check whether current master is green before releasing
allow a sql result to link to sqlui urls. maybe this is the start of some built-in functions.
